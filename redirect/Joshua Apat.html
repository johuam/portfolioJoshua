        <h4><i>(by:Taylor Swift)</i></h4>
        
        <p>I'm so glad you made time to see me
            <br>How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
            <br>I haven't seen them in a while
            <br>You've been good, busier than ever
            <br>We small talk, work and the weather
            <br>Your guard is up and I know why</p>

            <p>Because the last time you saw me
             <br>   Is still burned in the back of your mind
              <br>  You gave me roses and I left them there to die</p>

              <p>So this is me swallowin' my pride
               <br> Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
               <br> And I go back to December all the time
               <br> It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
               <br> Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
               <br>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
               <br> I go back to December all the time</p>

               <p>These days, I haven't been sleepin'
                <br> Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
                <br> When your birthday passed and I didn't call
                <br>Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
                <br>I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
                <br> And realized I loved you in the fall</p>

                <p>And then the cold came, the dark days
                  <br>  When fear crept into my mind
                  <br> You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye</p>

                  <p>So this is me swallowin' my pride
                   <br> Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
                   <br> And I go back to December all the time
                   <br>It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
                   <br> Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
                   <br> I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
                   <br>I go back to December all the time</p>

                   <p> miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
                    <br>So good to me, so right
                    <br>And how you held me in your arms that September night
                    <br>The first time you ever saw me cry
                    <br>Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
                    <br>Probably mindless dreamin'
                    <br>But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right</p>

                    <p>I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
                      <br>  So if the chain is on your door, I understand</p>

                      <p>But this is me swallowin' my pride
                        <br> Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
                        <br> And I go back to December
                        <br> It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
                        <br> Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
                        <br>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
                        <br>I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
                        <br>I go back to December all the time
                        <br>All the time.</p>
